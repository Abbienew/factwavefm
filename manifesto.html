                    <h3>Manifesto</h3><hr/><br>
                    <p>Welcome to FactWave FM core beliefs and principles. <br><br>
                        At FactWave FM, our ethos is anchored in the epistemological imperative of authentic, 
                        fact-based journalism. Amidst sensational narratives such as "China Attacks Taiwan," 
                        The radio navigates the nuanced landscape of mediated reality that confronts Taiwanese society daily. 
                        The FactWave FM tells the semiotic potency of news is constituted not merely by its linguistic content, 
                        but also by its paralinguistic expression. 
                        In merging these considerations, FactWave FM seeks to revolutionize the radio experience by 
                        leveraging emotional AI. FactWave FM is to transcend traditional auditory engagement, 
                        curating a uniquely emotional and interactive soundscape that augments not just the dissemination 
                        of news, but also its emotional resonance with the audience.
                        <br><br>
                    <h4>Project Brief</h4><hr/><br>
                    <p>Keywords : Radio, Artificial Intellegence, Voice, Emotion, Magical Realism, News, the Internet, Affective Media</p>
                    <p>《FactWave FM: "Where Truth Blends with Trend"》 is a multimedia art project that delves into the future integration of artificial intelligence technology into synthetic media, 
                    creating an immersive experience of real-time news broadcasting. Inspired by recent incidents of real-generated artificial intelligence news reports, 
                    such as the "Pentagon Explosion," which caused panic in the United States, this project combines emotionally-driven news content with AI voice technology. 
                    By blending human creativity with AI-generated content, FactWave FM challenges traditional news consumption patterns.<br><br>
                    As a Taiwanese individual, I personally face a significant amount of fake news from the Chinese government. 
                    Through "FactWave FM: "Where Truth Blends with Trend," I hope to express the sentiments of being Taiwanese and empower audiences from diverse cultures to navigate the vast ocean of false and real news. 
                    The project will be presented through an interactive broadcast structure powered by artificial intelligence, 
                    reshaping the audience's relationship with news and inviting their participation in exploring the truth within today's complex media landscape using generative AI.</p> <br><br>
